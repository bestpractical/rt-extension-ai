=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-AI - AI Features for Request Tracker

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This RT extension introduces AI-powered features to enhance ticket handling efficiency and improve the user experience in Request Tracker (RT).

=over 4

=item 1. Autocomplete

This aids staff users in writing better responses and adding internal comments to support tickets. 
It also helps end-users submit better questions when creating and replying to tickets via the Self Service interface.
When a user starts to type in a content box, the current written text is set as context to ChatGPT, 
which suggests the next three words to the user. On pressing Tab, the suggestion will be appended to the current text.

=item 2. AI Filters

=over 4

=item * Adjust Tone/Voice: Modify the tone of the text.

=item * AI Suggestion: Provides suggestions or answers for user queries.

=item * Translate: Translates ticket content into different languages.

=back

=item 3. Ticket Sentiment

A custom field, Ticket Sentiment, has been added to classify ticket responses as Satisfied, Dissatisfied, or Neutral using OpenAI's API.

=item 4. Ticket Summarization

Automatically generates ticket summaries based on the ticket conversation between users and staff responses. This ensures clarity in ticket updates.

Request Body:

$rawText: Text content from CKEditor (either the selected portion or the entire text).
$popupLabel: The heading to display on the popup.

=head2 AISuggestion

AISuggestion File:

URL: /helper/OpenAiSuggestion/aisuggestion
This internal endpoint processes AI suggestions, tone adjustments, and translation requests. It leverages OpenAI endpoints internally, with the responses displayed in the AI popup.

The AISuggestion functionality depends on a configuration file for the OpenAI base URL, API key, and model settings.

$rawText: Input text from the user.
$callType: Specifies the type of request (e.g., aisuggestion, adjustTone, translate, autocomplete, etc.).

A new custom dropdown plugin named aiSuggestion has been added to the toolbar. This plugin includes dropdown options for features such as AI Suggestion, Adjust Tone, and Translat. Additionally, AI-powered autocomplete functionality has been implemented for the CKEditor text area.

The implementation involves making API calls to internal endpoints for all functionalities, and the responses are processed and displayed seamlessly within the editor text area.
